# array

Things that should probably be in the Go standard library

# Why

I find myself doing things like checking if a value is in an array a lot.
Since Go has the ability to do reflection very easily, I made this project
to only write array utilities once.

The inspiration for this project comes from SQL databases. I like the union,
intersect, and except operators, so this package will implement them.
